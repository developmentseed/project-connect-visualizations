Project Connect is a mission under UNICEF Innovation Office. We're applying deep learning and computer vision to assist the mission to put every school in the world on the map.

# Mapping schools in Africa, Asia and South America

We applied AI-assisted school mapping workflow to search map schools in Kenya, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, Niger, Ghana, Kazakhstan, Uzbekisthan and Honduras. 

# Schools maps visualization

The schools map visualizations presented shown the comparison between the schools validated for training data and the results from ML outputs validation.

In the maps for each countries we can see:

- Red dots are the known schools.
- Bright blue dots are the overlaps between known schools and the ML detection. This show how well are the ML detection.
- Yellow dots are the unmapped schools that were found with ML and human validation.
